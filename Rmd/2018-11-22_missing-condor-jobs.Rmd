The goal is to make a list of the condor jobs that still need to be run, ie, those that failed to run and should be re-run after dividing them into multiple jobs.

```{r}
library(qtl2chtc)
```

```{r}
find_missing_jobs(DIR = "../results/pvl-run3101", njobs = 80, outfile = "run3101-bad-runs"
                  )
```

We want to define a common region for all scans, so that we aren't changing the scan region for each trait.

From the file "2018-09-27_eQTL-identification.Rmd", we see that the traits' peaks range from marker index 485 to 1361. Thus, we need to take a superset of that interval. Let's look at 400 to 1399, a 1000-marker interval.

We can safely do a 200 by 200 scan in less than 3 days, so each 1000 by 1000 scan is broken into 25 200 by 200 scans.
