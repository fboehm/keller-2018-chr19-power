The 'final' results files are for runs 3104, 3105, 3106, and 3107. Each contains the two-dimensional scans (25 files per scan) for 79 pairs of traits. In each run, there are 79 genes each paired with a single "anchor" gene. 

Runs 3103, 3102, and 3101 are not needed and not used in the final analysis.
